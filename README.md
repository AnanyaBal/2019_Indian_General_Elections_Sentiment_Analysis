# 2019-General-Election-Sentiment-Analysis
This project uses tweets extracted with the help of the Twitter API to project the general public sentiment for the 2019 Indian General Elections. With the help of different queries, and parameters such as geographical coordinates, time period and radius, I have extracted tweets for different Leaders and National Parties. Once the sentiment values for positive, negative and neutral tweets is calculated, I have taken the positive values for 30 different cities in India and plotted the values on a map.
